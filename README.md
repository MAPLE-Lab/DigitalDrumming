# DigitalDrumming
A visualization of a project examining Steve Reich's Drumming.

Drumming calls for percussionists to play in synchrony, then for one voice to gradually speed up as others remain steady. In practice however, there is an interesting dynamic between the two drummers as each one "pulls" each others timings to themselves.

The visualizer you see here was developed to help explore this phenomenon.
